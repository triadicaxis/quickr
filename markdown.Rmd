# Title

## Section

### Sub-section

#### Sub-sub-section (let's not get carried away)

Here is a section line break (using three of underscores, but you can use three or more dashes or asterixes too):

This is just a normal text block with some `typewriter text` inserted.  
This is just a normal text block with some *italic text* inserted.  
This is just normal text with some **bold text** inserted.  
This is just normal text with some ***bold italicised text*** inserted.  
(You must end a line with two or more spaces.)

#### Below is a code chunk
```{r}
## here is a code chunk
x <- c(1:30)
y <- 1.2
m <- matrix(data = x, nrow = 10, ncol = 3)
m
```

#### Below is the exact same code chunk, showing only the output
```{r echo=FALSE}
## here is a code chunk with source code hidden, only showing the output
x <- c(1:30)
y <- 1.2
m <- matrix(data = x, nrow = 10, ncol = 3)
m
n <- m*y
```

The sum of all the values of m is `r sum(m)`.  
The mean of all the values of x is `r mean(x)`.  
The standard deviation of x is `r sd(x)`.

Here is a bullet list, it requires a * and 1 space:

* First dot point
* Second dot point
    + A subpoint (requires 4 spaces, followed by * or +)
* Third dot point


Here is a numered list:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
    + Item 3a
    + Item 3b

#### Here is how you can get subscripts:

$H_0$: Some null hypothesis here.  
$H_1$: Some alternative hypothesis here.

Here is an equation: $PV=FV*(1+r)/t$  
Display equation: $$ PV=FV*(1+r)^{-t} $$ 
Note the superscript is *^something^* or in an equation $R^{2}$  
While we are at it, subscript is $y_{i,t}$  

#### Let's try a few real formulas:
Formula for mean is $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=i}^{n} x_{i}$  
Formula for fixed effects model is $y_{i,t} = \alpha_{i} + \beta x_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}$  

And here is an inline equation: $A = \pi*r^{2}$  

#### Below is a chart. I've set the size and hidden the source code.
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
plot(m, n)
```

Here is some text with a footnote.[^1]  
Here is some other text with another footnote.[^2]

Presumably this is a comment and won't show up. I've put the footnotes just below.

#### Finally a table:

|Header |Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3  | 
|:--- |:---- |:----:| ----:|
|1. Row| is | is | is  |
|2. Row| left | nicely | right  |
|3. Row| aligned | centered | aligned  |  

#### Bonus trick, a faked formatted table:

|Header  | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | 
|:------ |:-------- |:--------:| --------:|
|1. Row  | is       | is       | is       |
|2. Row  | left     | nicely   | right    |
|3. Row  | aligned  | centered | aligned  |  


|Var     | Sum of ..  | Mean of ..  | SD of ..   | 
|:------ | ----------:| -----------:| ----------:|
|1. x    | `r sum(x)` | `r mean(x)` | `r sd(x)`  |
|2. n    | `r sum(n)` | `r mean(n)` | `r sd(n)`  |
